## [Quickstart Examples](https://docs.othentic.xyz/main/avs-framework/quick-start)
A collection of examples designed to provide hands-on experience for integrating the Othentic Stack:

[Simple Price Oracle AVS Example JS](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/simple-price-oracle-avs-example)

A quickstart repository demonstrating an Oracle AVS implementation in JavaScript. It uses IPFS to store proof-of-task data, providing a simple yet powerful example for developers new to Othentic Stack.


[Simple Price Oracle AVS Example Go](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/avs-examples/tree/main/simple-price-oracle-avs-go-example)

This example demonstrates how to implement a simple price oracle AVS in Go.


[Simple Price Oracle AVS Example Rust](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/avs-examples/tree/main/simple-price-oracle-avs-rust-example)

This example demonstrates how to implement a simple price oracle AVS in Rust.


[PRNG AVS](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/PRNG-avs-example)

This example demonstrates all the advanced features of the CLI including leader election mechanism, Hooks Implementation, Custom Task Triggers and more.


[Uniswap V4 Hook AVS Example](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/avs-examples/tree/main/uniswap-v4-hook-avs-example)

This example demonstrates how to utilize Uniswap V4 hooks to create dynamic fee AVS that addresses the inefficiencies of static fee models in swap contracts.

## Additional Examples
The following examples are not actively maintained, and some may be outdated compared to the current implementation.

[Simple Price Oracle Example with EigenDA](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/price-oracle-example-eigenda)  

This example showcases how to utilize **EigenDA** for storing proof-of-task data, providing a scalable and efficient data availability solution for AVSs.


[DNS Registry AVS](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/dnsRegistry-avs/) 

Demonstrates how to implement a decentralized DNS registry using AVS. It focuses on integrating domain management functionality with Othentic Stack.


[Lumina Intent AVS](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/lumina-intent-avs/)

An example of intent-based transaction management using Lumina and AVS. It highlights how to handle user intents within decentralized systems.


[AVS-ML](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/avs-ml/)

Illustrates how machine learning models can be incorporated into Othenticâ€™s AVS framework. This repo is ideal for developers looking to blend ML and decentralized solutions.


[Access Control AVS](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/access-control-avs/)

Focuses on decentralized access control using AVS. It provides examples of permission management within applications powered by Othentic Stack.


[Liveliness AVS](https://github.com/Othentic-Labs/Liveliness-AVS/) 

Showcases an AVS implementation to ensure system liveliness and availability checks, critical for maintaining robust decentralized services.
